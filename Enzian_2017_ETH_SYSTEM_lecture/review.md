#### Challenge 1 Get the hardware:

- only designed to use internally in the company
- e.g. you can't get hands on TPU and run experiment in your lab. you can only run tensorflow with TPU on the cloud

#### Challenge 2 Get the documentation

- e.g. catapult from microsoft, no documentation ,only a binary windows driver
- even if you have a smart person figure out how things work, you will encounter the next challenge

#### Challenge 3 The big decisions have already been made

- If you want to do high impact long term research on a platform which has been designed for a particularly use case, you will seriously constrain what you can do.
- You are essentially doing research into what the designers of the hardware thought you should do.
- If you want to do the research into what custom hardware should look like, you should not use such hardware.

#### Enzian v.1

- the two connected by a coherence bus (Cavium coherence protocol?)
- we really don't like PCI?



They want to make many people in research to use that things because they thought that is useful.
